    "# COMP47670 Assignment 2\n",
    "## Robert Keenan 15333066\n",
    "## Date: 27/04/20\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this assignment was to scrape a number of customer reviews from a set of websites and to evaluate the performance of a number of text classification algorithms on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I needed to make use of BeautifulSoup to be able to scrape the reviews off of the website for a select number of catergories before storing the reviews and their sentiments, the review as positive or negative depending on the number of stars. \n",
    "The review categories are located on the website http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/ and are separated into a number of different categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Review Categories\n",
    "The first step was to choose 3 of the 7 categories to scrap data from. From here, I could inspect the webpage using 'Inspect Element' on the browswer where I could identify any of the common characteristics of the categories for access. The 3 chosen categories are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automotive Category (132 businesses)\n",
    "- Gym Category (122 businesses)\n",
    "- Hotel Category (113 businesses)\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the aim was to enter into each categories webpage which contains a list of businesses in the categories shown above. Each link for a business contains a number of reviews related to that business and it was required to store each of these reviews in a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining each category's URL\n",
    "The first step involved in scraping the category URLs which would allow me to enter the category page where all of the businesses are listed. To do this, I initially investigated how the webpage was set up using 'Inspect Element' in the browser. To obtain the URLs of each category link, I noticed that each link was off a class =\"category\". More specifically, I could obtain the URLs for each category by searching for the `<a>` tag in the HTML using BeautifulSoup. The `<a>` tag represents a hyperlink that is present on the webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the hyperlink corresponding to the list of automotive companies is given in the `<a>` as automotive_list.html. As a result, the corresponding link needed to enter the webpage containing the list of businesses is http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/yalp/automotive_list.html . This link can be obtained by gathering each of the  hyperlinks in a `<a>` tag and adding a `/` to the front of the corresponding html link so it can be joined to the original Yalp Homepage URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I built a function as shown below which using the BeautifulSoup HTML parser could obtain all of the `<a>` tags with the hyperlinks and store them in a list along with the prepending `/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I needed to also make sure that the homepage URL or the index URL for 'Yalp-Home' was not included in the list of category links. The function is shown below. It was built to take an argument of the main URL (the yalp homepage) as well as a list of the categories wanted, `categories_wanted`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function is called inside another function which is used to gather the URLs of the businesses. It is commented fully below. "

    "### Obtaining the Business URLs and Reviews before storing\n",
    "Once I have obtained the URLs for the categories, I need to obtain the business links in each category using BeautifulSoup before then obtaining each review for each of these and storing the sentiment (positive/negative) and the review text. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I built another function which could take the link (original Yalp homepage link) and the category which needs to be obtained. I again used 'Inspect Element' to see how the webpage was structured. To obtain the different business links, I used the function shown above `get_url_categories` and then I could iterate through this list of companies and using BeautifulSoup to analyse the content of an individual business' review webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "Using 'Inspect Element', I could see that a review review had a class of `class = \"review\"` and had a `<div>` tag which is associated with a division or section in the webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the sentiment of a review, I can use the stars associated with it. The stars are an image which can be found using the `<img>` tag in the HTML with BeautifulSoup. The `alt` attribute of the `<img>` tag can be used to find how many stars the review image actually corresponds to. I can then take a review as negative if the `alt` attribute is less than 4 stars and a review is positive if the `alt` attribute is 4 or 5 stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the text of a review, the `<p>` tag is used as well as the class `class = \"review-text\"`. The text of the review can then be stored and appended to a dataframe as well as the corresponding sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Through my analysis of the reviews and the business in each category, I noticed that some of the businesses are located in the province of Quebec (QC) in Canada where French is commonly spoken in everyday life. As a result, some of these reviews are in French compared to the vast majority of other reviews in English. \n",
    "As the French words will still be associated with the 'sentiment' of the review (positive/negative), I will carry out an analysis to see if stemming has any effect on the English data using English stop words and thus, it would have no effect leaving the French words unstemmed. "

    "## Task 2\n",
    "As described before, the content of each review is textual and not numeric. In order to analyse the review text data, we need to get a numeric representation of the data which can be done through tokenising. This is the process where the raw review text data is split up into tokens where each token is corresponding to an individual word/term in the review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways of doing this such as splitting the raw review text on white space/spaces between the words or even punctuation. In some cases, such as social media data (Twitter), certain special characters can be used to split the associated data such as '#'\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I can make use of scikit learn's (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)tokenising functions and more specifically can use stemming and lematisation through their vectorizers. To obtain optimal and minimal computation of the number of documents to be studied, it is often intended to reduce the number of terms used to represent a document or in our case, a review's text. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimum term length: Exclude terms of length < 2\n",
    "- Case conversion: All terms are set to lowercase\n",
    "- Stemming: Remove the endings of terms/words to remove the tense/plurals. \n",
    "- Lemmatisation: Process to reduce a term to its canonical form. \n",
    "- Stop-word filtering: Remove highly frequent terms which appear in a given list of words which can be gathered from the NLTK library. These words are highly frequent words with little information like 'and' & 'the'.\n",
    "- Low frequency filtering: Remove terms that appear in very few reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "However it was found that the stop-words mentioned above given by the NLTK library are not stemmed or lematised so sometimes the vectorizer can see a stop-word as plural. For example, I encountered this issue with the word 'always'. When the Lemma Tokenizer built below is applied to this word, it stems and lemmatises it to 'alway'. The word 'always' is contained in the English stop-words list and thus, there is a mismatch. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, I decided to stem the English step words using `PorterStemmer()` provided by NLTK. As a result, the stemmed stop-words could be applied to the stemmed review text. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can then create a vectorizer using the lemma tokenizer defined below as well as the stemmed English stop-words. I decided to use a TF-IDF vectorizer which weights the score of a certain term in a document. This will allow me to make a document-term matrix out of the data. The TF-IDF vectorizer is useful compared to the Count Vectorizer as it takes into account how many documents/reviews the term appears in. For example, if the term 'car' appears 100 times in one review but the term 'bad' appears 10 times in 10 reviews, then 'bad; would rank higher in terms of importance than the other word 'car' which didn't appear in as many separate reviews. This is how it weights the score of a certain term:\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used the `make_pipeline()` from Sklearn to allow me to easily apply a vectorizer and model to a certain categories of reviews. This allows me to apply a list of transforms to transform the data into a document-term matrix before applying a final estimator or classification model to the data. This is a useful way in Sklearn of shortening the amount of code nedeed for a repeated process. \n",

    "- Gym: The Naive Bayes obtains a classification accuracy of 86%. This is reasonably good classification accuracy but it might also be misinterpreted. The column heading above called 'support' denotes the number of examples of each class label (positive or negative) as we can see there is quite a large imbalance in the test data. Classification accuracy can be an inaccurate measured of classifier performance in this case. F1_score is a high performing measure which takes the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is a better indicator of classifier performance in imbalanced test data sets. The F1-Score is 0.90 for Positive reviews which shows that the classifier is quite good at predicting positive reviews but is poor in relation to Negative reviews with a F1-score of 0.77 which suggests that the model predicts too many real negative reviews as positive. This can be seen in the confusion matrix where there are over 236 False Positives in comparison to only 465 True Negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hotel: Again the Naive Bayes classifier performs very well for predicting the hotel data. It achieves a classification accuracy of 92% but again the test set is imbalanced with 1176 positive reviews and 824 negative reviews. The F1-score for the hotel data results are much better than the Gym data. A F1-Score of 0.93 for positive reviews and 0.90 for negative reviews suggests that the model performs extremely well for hotel data. This could be to do with similar language to describe a stay at a hotel and an automotive garage as both of them are providing a service. "

    "- Automotive Data: The Naive Bayes obtains a classification accuracy of 86% which is the same which the Automotive model predicted for Gyms. Again, this is reasonably good classification accuracy. There is again an imbalance in the test data for the Automotive category with 1212 positive reviews and 788 negative reviews. Using the F1-score, I can comment on the performance of the model. The F1-Score obtained for positive reviews is again high at 0.88 which is quite close to the classification accuracy. It achieves a F1-score of 0.84 for negative reviews which again is quite respectable but we suffer from a lot of False Negative reviews which is shown as 221 in the confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hotel Data: The Naive Bayes classifier again performs very well with the Hotel data but this time trained on the Gym data. It obtains a classification accuracy of 92%. The test classes are imbalanced as we have already found out and the F1-scores are very high also which indicates that the model is very good at generalising data for the Hotel category. It obtains a F1-score for positive reviews of 0.93 and 0.90 for negative reviews which is very good. There is a low amount of False Positives and False Negatives at 123 and 41 respectively. This suggests that the Naive Bayes model trained on the Gym data performs very well with Hotel data. "

    "- Gym Data: The classifier training on hotel data performs very well with Positive reviews obtaining an F1-score of 0.90. However, it obtains quite a poor F1-score for negative reviews and this is due to the number of False positives given in the confusion matrix (236) which are False Negatives in the case of the Negative class. These cause the recall to decrease dramatically to 0.66 which is quite poor. As a result, I can conclude that the Naive Bayes classifier trained on hotel data is quite good at classifying positive reviews but poor at classifying negative reviews. "
